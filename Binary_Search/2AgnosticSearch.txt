in this question array is sorted but it is not given whether it is sorted in ascending or descending
order.

first check if there is only element that compare it with the target if it's equal return true else false

then to check order , compare any two elements check which one is greater , by this you can find out 
the order , we are checking for single element in first case because if there is no 2nd element how we can compare 
it 

after finding the order , apply binary search accordingly .
